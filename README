OEM PHP Framework
-----------------

OEM is a rather simple, Public Domain licenced framework for programmers needing to create medium-complexity, custom web applications. It supports multi-domain, multi-app setups from the same codebase and is built using modern PHP features, such as namespaces and auto-loading. As of August 2012 The project has just started, although the code has been already used in several projects of my own.

My name is Michal Tatarynowicz, I'm a web developer. In the past I've started and lead the CakePHP project.
